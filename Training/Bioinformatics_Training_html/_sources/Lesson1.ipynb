    "Unix is an OS that originated from the 1960s and directly or indirectly the ancestors of most OS you can see today (Ubuntu, macOS, Android). However, whenever we say \"unix or unix-like environment\", it often pertains to the command-line interface that are associated with programming and computer science. Before we start the tutorial, let us brief on the terminologies you'll often hear.\n",

    "|Kernel|are core programs in an operating system that manage and bridge processes/programs and the hardware (e.g. Linux, Windows NT, etc.)|\n",
    "|Shell|is the interface that you interact with the computer. This is primarily divided as **GUI** or *graphical user interface* and the **CLI** *command-line interface*|\n",
    "|GUI|is the interface in which you utilise visual to interact with the computer|\n",

    "Command line interface is primary mode of interaction when running in high performance computing clusters. The additional computing requirement often associated with graphical interface results in most bioinformatics programs and pipeline to be run through command-line interface. In addition to draining computing resources, running GUI-based programs often can be time consuming as you might need to manually click and analyse individual data. Meanwhile, through programming language such as BASH and other softwares in the command-line, you can parallelize your analysis.\n",

    "* To open **command prompt** on Windows:\n",

    "\n",
    "The `mv` command can be used also to rename files and folder. You can try renaming `example.txt` to any other name. An example: `mv example.txt example_edited.txt2`. Run a `ls` afterward.\n",

    "\n",
    "Files can be created through several ways. Programs can create output files based on their output parameters. You can also create your own `text files` by writing in a text editor. Akin to `notepad` in windows, you can write text files using several programs such as `vim` and `nano`. When creating new text files in this programs, just run the commands:\n",

    "\n",
    "The previous example would create the text file ```newtextfile.txtextensioniwant``` inside the folder `data/`. If you notice, the file extension (anything beyond `.`) is not written as the usual `.txt` file extension. In most cases in a terminal, you can even drop the extension and it will still be treated as a text file. Extensions are just helpful guides for user to know what type of file or program run those file. More on this will be discuss in future lessons.\n",
    "> üìù **Note**: Windows text editors often have different way of representing `tabs` or `newlines` than in MacOS and Linux OSes and can affect your program or analyses. However, they can still be open and edited in a Linux or MacOS terminal/text editor.\n",
