    "# Bioinformatics Training: Lesson 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Operations\n",
    "### Auto-completion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us return to our home directory `cd ~`. In this directory, create three folders named `test11`, `test20`, and `test21` using the `mkdir` command. Check your folder using `ls`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, try typing `head te` and tap the **tab button** once. As you can see, it should auto-complete it to test as it is the next complete `string` without conflict in our folder. Now, that we have `head test` in our line, try tapping the **tab button** twice. It should ring a bell and prompt all possible matches with our initial user input.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```test11   test20   test21```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wildcards\n",
    "Sometimes, we need to work on multiple files folders at the same time but they have different names (e.g. the test1, test 20 and test21). The default command-line shell that we are using allows manipulation of the files through the use of special characters called wildcards `*`. \n",
    ">***<ins>Try running this command:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```ls te*```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command results in listing all files in the folder that starts with `te`. This can be used also in a more specific manner. \n",
    ">***<ins>Try running this command:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```ls test*1```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the wildcard within the string matches anyword that starts with `test` and ends with `1`.  It is useful also when runnning commands of files with the same file extension: ```cp *.fasta ./folder/```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "At the command line, the * means any character, any number of times (including 0 times).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try removing all the folder we made earlier that start with `test` simultaneously:\n",
    ">***<ins>Try running this command:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```rm -r test*```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "⚠️ Removing files using wildcards should be done carefully as use of wildcards can result in unintended results (e.g. using `rm *` to delete all files within the folder)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Question Mark\n",
    "Another type of wildcard is the use of `?` mark. Unlike the `*` which can match 1 or more strings e.g. (`test11111` and `test11`), the use of `test*1` will match both files while use of `test?1` will only match `test11`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">***<ins>Try running this command:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```ls test?1```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one matches your query?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redirectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The redirection symbols allow the change of destination of outputs (oe even inputs in some instances). Rather than outputs directly showing to your terminal screen, it can be redirected to another command or file. Additionally, redirectors can also be use to push an input to a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The '>' and '<'\n",
    "The '>' redirector indicates that the output of any command or process on its left will be transferred to a file indicated on its right. It's most basic structure follows this: ```[command] [any arguments] > [output file]```\n",
    ">***<ins>Try running this command:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```ls -all > list.txt```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">then, open `list.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Be warned that using an `>` output redirector with an output file that already exists in the destination will lead to the overwriting of that file. To append an existing file (adding output on the end of the file), please use the append `>>` redirector instead.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the '<' redirector indicates  that the file in the right of the `<` will be used as an input to the command to its left: ```[command][options/arguments] < [input file]```\n",
    ">***<ins>Example:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```mail -s \"News Today\" gccab@ymail.com < NewsFlash.zip\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we can add the attachment `NewsFlash.zip` to the command line `mail` command rather than just sending plain text for email. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The `mail` command is command-line command used to send email. It is useful to incorporate in programs or scripts that need immediate notification to the user if they have errors or the run have finished.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The pipe '|'\n",
    "If you want your output to be redirected not into a file but to another process or command, the `|` or pipe redirector is primarily used. It can be used not only once on a line but can be used to chain several commands to gether. A basic structure would look like this: `[command 1] | [command 2] | [command 3] > [output file or STDOUT]`\n",
    ">***<ins>Try running this command:</ins>***\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```ls ./data/all | head -n 20 > list.txt```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error redirectors \n",
    "Several programs often outputed also the errors in STDOUT or terminal screen. You can separate the errors and redirect it to a new distinct file using `2>` redirection. It works similar as the normal output redirection but the difference is it will only filter 'error' outputs designated by the program you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'error' redirector `2>` can be used alongside a 'output' redirector but designate it as such `1>`. One example would be like this: ```head nonexistentfile.txt 1> file.out 2> file.err```. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bioinformatic File types and formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence File Formats\n",
    "Sequencing of DNA and RNA often produce signals of light, chromatogram peaks or electric current as an indication of a nucleotide base. These raw signals are converted into ASCII or computer friendly code using a 'basecaller' or basecalling program. Most of the files that we analysed in bioinformatic analysis are already in this ASCII or alphanumeric format that is readable to both machines and humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about basecaller, please look into in this [nanopore guide](https://nanoporetech.com/platform/technology/basecalling).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The  FASTQ format\n",
    "The most common file format after basecalling is the ***fastq*** format or colloquially known as *Quality FASTA* format. The fastq files contained both nucleotide sequence information, represented with characters as AGCTN*, and the quality score of each nucleotide, which are represented by different alphanumeric characters. The quality score is based on **Phred Q Score** system in which quality is computed as probabilty of error *Pe* [2], as computed by this equation: \n",
    ">`Qphred=-10 x log10(Pe)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastQ file format is composed of four lines:\n",
    "1. Line 1 is the sequence identifier and description and commonly known as *header*. It often starts with '@' symbol and followed with sequencing information such as sequencer and flow cell lane used.\n",
    "2. The second line contains the RAW sequence data and denoted using `AGCT` characters used in FASTA file.\n",
    "3. Line 3 contains the `+` symbol that separates sequences and quality\n",
    "4. The fourthe line meanwhiles contains the quality score of the file in Phred Score Format\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"image3\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Phred Score\n",
    "The quality scores ranges from 0-40 with 40 indicating the highest level of quality. Phred quality score can be interpreted as a factor of accuracy as shown in this table:\n",
    "<center>Quality Scores and Accuracy</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "|Phred Score|Probability of incorrect call|Base Call Accuracy|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",

    "|20|1 in 100|99%|\n",
    "|30|1 in 1,000|99.9%|\n",
    "|40|1 in 10,000|99.99%|\n",
    "\n",

    "Phred-64 format is only used by Illumina sequencers while Phred-33 is primarily used by other sequencing file format.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The  FASTA format\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTA files are the most common file format you will encounter when doing bioinformatic analysis. Unlike FASTQ files with quality score, FASTA files primarily contains only the sequence information using `AGCT` characters for nucleotides. Aside from this, the `N` and `*` are also used as unspecified based and stop character.\n",

It often has the sequence name and other properties depending on the program used. The second line is composed of the nucleotide sequence file. This can be on capital or small characters.\n",

    "### Alignment Format\n",
    "In many downstream analysis, fasta/fastq files are aligned to create a large genome sequence file. Among the most common alignment format used here are the **SAM** and **BAM** format. 'BAM' is the binary file format of 'SAM' and often used for its smaller file size. \n",
