    "## Getting Started with ARC (Advanced Research Computing) at the University of Calgary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a quick-start guide for accessing and using ARC systems at the University of Calgary for high-performance computing tasks such as bioinformatics analysis, data processing, and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Getting Access\n",
    "\n",
    "To access ARC:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Register for an ARC account at: [https://rcs.ucalgary.ca/How_to_get_an_account](https://rcs.ucalgary.ca/How_to_get_an_account)\n",
    "2. You will receive login credentials and instructions after approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Connecting to ARC\n",
    "\n",
    "Use SSH (Secure Shell) to log in from your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your user name>@arc.ucalgary.ca\n",
    "```\n",
    "Username is the same name you use for your University email (**john.doe** for an email with **john.doe@ucalgary.ca**).\n",
    "\n",
    "If using Windows, install a terminal like Git Bash or use [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/). Alternatively, you can connect to the **SHELL TERMINAL** of ARC through your local browser. Just use the [Open On-Demand ARC Shell Access](https://ood-arc.rcs.ucalgary.ca/pun/sys/shell/ssh/arc.ucalgary.ca)\n",

    "### 3. Transferring Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `scp` or `rsync` to move data between your local machine and ARC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upload a file to ARC:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "scp myfile.txt yourusername@arc.ucalgary.ca:/home/yourusername/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download a file from ARC:\n",

    "scp yourusername@arc.ucalgary.ca:/home/yourusername/results.csv .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Modules and Software\n",
    "\n",
    "ARC uses **Environment Modules** to manage software. Load what you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module avail        # List all available modules\n",
    "module load fastqc  # Load a specific tool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Softwares through Package Managers and environment management systems\n",
    "\n",
    "ARC allows the usage of software installed in environment management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Package Manager (i.e. PIP and Conda) allows you to install softwares. Meanwhile, environment management system (Python Env and Conda)  allows you to manage software in isolated environments. For example, one workflow requires PERL 5.41 but another needs PERL 6.1. An environment management system allows you to install different versions of software concurrently onto two different environments.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common you will encounter are Python Virtual Environment (Python VENV) and CONDA. For detail installation please follow the following links:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. File Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- To check your space in ARC use `arc.quota`\n",
    "- Your home directory has limited quota (typically 500GB).\n",
    "- For large files, use `/scratch` or `/project` space.\n",
    "- Use `du -sh *` to check folder sizes.\n",

    "### 1. What is SLURM?\n",
    "\n",
    "SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is an open-source job scheduler used by many high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. It manages and allocates resources like CPUs, memory, and GPUs for your computational jobs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Job**: A script or command submitted to the queue.\n",
    "- **Node**: A physical machine in the cluster.\n",
    "- **Partition**: A queue of nodes, usually grouped by capabilities (e.g., `short`, `long`, `gpu`).\n",
    "- **Scheduler**: The system that decides when and where jobs run.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "sbatch job.slurm   # Submit a batch job\n",

    "- Always test scripts with small data first.\n",
